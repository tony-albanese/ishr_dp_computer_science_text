\chapter{Dummy Chapter}

The chapter should start with perhaps a quote followed by the main objective of the unit. 

The \textbf{objective} of the unit should be specially formatted so that is visually stands out from the rest of the text.


\section{Subtopics}
This is where the meat of the chapters lives. Each section should be a standalone section of text that makes sense. Here there should be sections for \textbf{positive information} and \textbf{negative information} that are screened separately. 

There should also be exercises based on past papers which students can practice their work.

\section{More subtopics}

The subsections continue. And they will continue.


\section{Past Paper Questions}

Each section should end with past paper questions. These could be built into the chapter or this could be a link to online resources.
