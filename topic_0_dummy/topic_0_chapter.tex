\chapter{Dummy Chapter}
The chapter should start with perhaps a quote followed by the main objective of the unit. 

The \textbf{objective} of the unit should be specially formatted so that is visually stands out from the rest of the text.


\section{Subtopics}
This is where the meat of the chapters lives. Each section should be a standalone section of text that makes sense. 
	\begin{positiveInformation}{Positive Information}
		This is an environment for screening positive information. In other words, this is what the user ought to do and is for best practices.
	\end{positiveInformation}
There should also be exercises based on past papers which students can practice their work.

\section{More subtopics}

The subsections continue. And they will continue. Made some more changes.
It is also important to have an environment where students can have negative information.

\begin{negativeInformation}{Worst practices}
	It is also important to avoid the following mistakes in your code base.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Null pointers
		\item Exposing your variables
		\item Not commenting your code.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{negativeInformation}


\section{Past Paper Questions}

Each section should end with past paper questions. These could be built into the chapter or this could be a link to online resources.
